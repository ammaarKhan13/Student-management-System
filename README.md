# Student-management-System

Introduction
A Student Management System is a comprehensive software application that
facilitates educational institutions in managing their day-to-day operations. It is
designed to integrate and automate various administrative tasks of educational
institutions, including registration, admissions, attendance tracking, grade
management, and examination management.
The Student Management System has become an essential tool for educational
institutions of all sizes, from small primary schools to large universities. In this tutorial,
we’ll create such a Student Management System Project in Python with MySQL.
It will help to manage the following tasks:
1. Add new data of a student.
2. View the information of an existing student.
3. Update or modify a student’s data.
4. Delete the record of a student.

The Project Details
The graphical interface of this project is managed by the Tkinter library. The PyM ySQL
package is used here to manage database operations using python.
The project folder contains three python files, main.py, custom.py,
and credentials.py. As the name of main.py, it handles all the tasks. custom.py has
information about the color and font used by the main program. credentials.py or
the final file contains credentials to log in to the MySQL server. Here, users need to
enter their own Username and Password for the MySQL server.
